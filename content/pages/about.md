          Our classes are high-intensity and will get your heart pumping, so
          make sure to consult your doctor before climbing with us.  If you are
          vulnerable in any way to flashing lights and loud music, Rise Nation
          is probably not a good fit for you.  Please make sure that your
          handlebars are securely fastened and that your feet are firmly and
          evenly placed on the pedals before class begins.

          Our Studios are dimly lit for the majority of the class and our
          climbers have hand rails and vertical posts that can obstruct your
          path if you are not careful.  If you have to walk through the room
          after the lights have been dimmed, please walk slowly and
          deliberately, and also, keep the walkways free of any objects that
          another person may trip over.
