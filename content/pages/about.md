          Nothing too tricky here, just be ready to sweat! An athletic shirt or
          tank top with form-fitting leggings, shorts or other athletic bottom
          and athletic shoes will suffice.

        Our classes are high-intensity and will get your heart pumping, so make sure to consult your doctor before climbing with us.  If you are vulnerable in any way to flashing lights and loud music, Rise Nation is probably not a good fit for you.  Please make sure that your handlebars are securely fastened and that your feet are firmly and evenly placed on the pedals before class begins.  
        Our Studios are dimly lit for the majority of the class and our climbers have hand rails and vertical posts that can obstruct your path if you are not careful.  If you have to walk through the room after the lights have been dimmed, please walk slowly and deliberately, and also, keep the walkways free of any objects that another person may trip over.
