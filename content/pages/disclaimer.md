  CANCELLATION AND BOOKING POLICIES


  In order to cancel a Power Up class, you may cancel online or by calling the
  studio NO LATER THAN 24 hours prior to your scheduled class. Once your class
  is canceled by this time it will be returned to your account. If you have not
  canceled your class by the 24 hour window, the online system will not permit
  you to do so. Cancellations via electronic mail (email), Facebook messenger,
  Instagram, or text message will not be taken and you will be charged.


  You can cancel your reservation in the following ways:


  Login to your Power Up account and next to the class you wish to cancel, press
  “Unreserve”.


  If you attempt to cancel past the 24 hour window, a late cancellation fee of
  $15 will be charged to your account and the class returned. If you do not have
  a working card on file, your class will be forfeited. If you do not cancel and
  do not show up to your class, a no-show fee of $22 will be charged to your
  account and the class returned. If you do not have a working card on file,
  your class will be forfeited. If you are on an auto debit contract or
  unlimited package and do not have a working card on file for such fees, your
  package will be reduced by one day and your auto debit contract will be
  terminated from renewal.


  The no-show and late cancel fees apply to ALL packages equally regardless of
  unlimited status or special package pricing.


  If you book multiple classes or waitlist multiple classes, you are solely
  responsible for canceling your classes within the bounds of the cancellation
  policy. Power Up staff cannot be held responsible for accidental bookings by
  clients or double bookings or double waitlisted classes made by clients. Late
  cancel and no show fees apply if you do not cancel within the bounds of the
  cancellation policy for double bookings.


  If you add yourself to a waitlist, YOU are solely responsible for managing
  your bookings and for canceling your classes within the bounds of the
  cancellation policy. The system will auto-populate clients into class from the
  waitlist as other clients with confirmed spots cancel and bikes will be
  assigned as such. Power Up staff cannot move Power Towers for clients in
  classes that are completely full with wait lists.


  Please be aware that we release Power Towers EXACTLY five minutes prior to the
  start of class to those on the waitlist. If you are running late, please CALL
  the studio and speak to the front desk to assure we hold your bike. Power Up
  staff will add walk-in waitlisted clients in the order in which they were
  added to the waitlist by the computer system, top to bottom, and EXACTLY 5
  minutes prior to the start of class. There is no wait list priority given for
  early arrival. Clients who are already enrolled with a confirmed spot in a
  waitlisted class will only be permitted to switch bikes AFTER the wait list
  has been filled.


  You MUST SIGN IN next to your name upon arrival. If you do not sign in, we may
  release your bike to another guest 5 minutes prior to the start of class. DO
  NOT ASSUME THE FRONT DESK STAFF KNOWS YOU ARE IN ATTENDANCE.


  PACKAGE PURCHASES AND CREDIT CARDS ON FILE


  By purchasing a package from Power Up, you agree to our terms and conditions
  in full. Packages cannot be shared between clients. Unlimited and auto debit
  contract clients are required to keep a credit card on file. If a client
  holding an unlimited or auto debit package does not keep a card on file, their
  contract will be terminated and the package will not renew if holding an auto
  debit package. If a client on an unlimited or auto debit contract either
  cancels late or does not show to class, and no credit card is on file, the
  package will be reduced by one day and the auto debit contract suspended.


  Specially priced expiring packages may not be extended, transferred, refunded,
  shared, or frozen. Packages that expire will activate on the first class
  either booked OR waitlisted. Placing yourself on a waitlist with an expiring
  package will, in fact, activate your package. Power Up staff will not adjust
  or extend special packages due to waitlisted classes or accidental bookings
  through the acts or omissions of clients. The expiration date set on an
  expiring package is the date on which the package may no longer be used.
  Clients purchasing expiring packages do so with the understanding of these
  terms and agree to be bound by such.


  Clients may elect to keep a credit card on file using their Power Up account
  online. By placing a card on file, the cardholder and account holder gives
  permission to the Power Up staff to charge the card for any auto debit
  packages and/or cancellation fees accrued in accordance with the Power Up
  cancellation policy detailed supra.


  AUTO DEBIT CONTRACTS


  The following terms and conditions apply if you are enrolled in an unlimited
  auto-debit contract:


  I, the Client, authorize Power Up to, on a recurring basis, automatically
  charge the debit or credit card account I specified, for monthly payments due
  on my unlimited auto-debit plan associated with my account. I understand that
  Power Up will initiate transfers/charges pursuant to this authorization not to
  exceed the amount shown on my auto debit contract and/or in connection with
  cancellation fees according to the Edge Studios cancellation policy. Power Up
  will initiate charges each month on the date my contract is set to renew.


  Power Up may discontinue processing of recurring charges if the Company is
  unable to secure funds from my debit or credit card I have authorized due to,
  but not limited to, insufficient or uncollected funds in the account or
  insufficient or inaccurate information I provided. I understand that the Power
  Up booking system allows for booking through the week regardless of the
  renewal date of my contract. I understand that if I am booked in classes past
  the date of renewal, and my credit or debit card fails to bill properly, I
  will be removed from any classes past the renewal date and notified via
  electronic mail. I understand that if I am removed from class due to the
  circumstances as described, it may not be possible to place me back into the
  class for which I was originally booked and that I will not be given any
  priority in waitlisted classes. I also understand that it is my responsibility
  to keep my card on file current and my billing address and zip code accurate.
  Power Up cannot be held responsible for errors in processing due to expired or
  inaccurate information.

  Power Up conducts high intensity, choreographed, cardio classes on the
  SynergyAIR Power Tower. Please be aware that temperatures may reach 30° in
  certain classes. Music will be played which may contain explicit language. If
