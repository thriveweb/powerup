Once your class is canceled by this time it will be returned to your account. If you have not canceled your class by the 12 hour window, the online system will not permit you to do so. Cancellations via electronic mail (email), Facebook messenger, Instagram, or text message will not be taken and you will be charged.\r\n\nYou can cancel your reservation in the following ways:\r\n\nLogin to your Power Up account and next to the class you wish to cancel, press “Unreserve”.\r\n\nIf you attempt to cancel past the 12 hour window, a late cancellation fee of $15 will be charged to your account and the class returned. If you do not have a working card on file, your class will be forfeited. If you do not cancel and do not show up to your class, a no-show fee of $22 will be charged to your account and the class returned. If you do not have a working card on file, your class will be forfeited. If you are on an auto debit contract or unlimited package and do not have a working card on file for such fees, your package will be reduced by one day and your auto debit contract will be terminated from renewal.\r\n\nThe no-show and late cancel fees apply to ALL packages equally regardless of unlimited status or special package pricing.\r\n\nIf you book multiple classes or waitlist multiple classes, you are solely responsible for canceling your classes within the bounds of the cancellation policy. Power Up staff cannot be held responsible for accidental bookings by clients or double bookings or double waitlisted classes made by clients. Late cancel and no show fees apply if you do not cancel within the bounds of the cancellation policy for double bookings.\r\n\nIf you add yourself to a waitlist, YOU are solely responsible for managing your bookings and for canceling your classes within the bounds of the cancellation policy. The system will auto-populate clients into class from the waitlist as other clients with confirmed spots cancel and bikes will be assigned as such. Power Up staff cannot move Power Towers for clients in classes that are completely full with wait lists.\r\n\nPlease be aware that we release Power Towers EXACTLY five minutes prior to the start of class to those on the waitlist. If you are running late, please CALL the studio and speak to the front desk to assure we hold your bike. Power Up staff will add walk-in waitlisted clients in the order in which they were added to the waitlist by the computer system, top to bottom, and EXACTLY 5 minutes prior to the start of class. There is no wait list priority given for early arrival. Clients who are already enrolled with a confirmed spot in a waitlisted class will only be permitted to switch bikes AFTER the wait list has been filled.\r\n\nYou MUST SIGN IN next to your name upon arrival. If you do not sign in, we may release your bike to another guest 5 minutes prior to the start of class. DO NOT ASSUME THE FRONT DESK STAFF KNOWS YOU ARE IN ATTENDANCE.\r\n\nPACKAGE PURCHASES AND CREDIT CARDS ON FILE\r\n\nBy purchasing a package from Power Up, you agree to our terms and conditions in full. Packages cannot be shared between clients. Unlimited and auto debit contract clients are required to keep a credit card on file. If a client holding an unlimited or auto debit package does not keep a card on file, their contract will be terminated and the package will not renew if holding an auto debit package. If a client on an unlimited or auto debit contract either cancels late or does not show to class, and no credit card is on file, the package will be reduced by one day and the auto debit contract suspended.\r\n\nSpecially priced expiring packages may not be extended, transferred, refunded, shared, or frozen. Packages that expire will activate on the first class either booked OR waitlisted. Placing yourself on a waitlist with an expiring package will, in fact, activate your package. Power Up staff will not adjust or extend special packages due to waitlisted classes or accidental bookings through the acts or omissions of clients. The expiration date set on an expiring package is the date on which the package may no longer be used. Clients purchasing expiring packages do so with the understanding of these terms and agree to be bound by such.\r\n\nClients may elect to keep a credit card on file using their Power Up account online. By placing a card on file, the cardholder and account holder gives permission to the Power Up staff to charge the card for any auto debit packages and/or cancellation fees accrued in accordance with the Power Up cancellation policy detailed supra.\r\n\nAUTO DEBIT CONTRACTS\r\n\nThe following terms and conditions apply if you are enrolled in an unlimited auto-debit contract:\r\n\nI, the Client, authorize Power Up to, on a recurring basis, automatically charge the debit or credit card account I specified, for monthly payments due on my unlimited auto-debit plan associated with my account. I understand that Power Up will initiate transfers/charges pursuant to this authorization not to exceed the amount shown on my auto debit contract and/or in connection with cancellation fees according to the Edge Studios cancellation policy. Power Up will initiate charges each month on the date my contract is set to renew.\r\n\nPower Up may discontinue processing of recurring charges if the Company is unable to secure funds from my debit or credit card I have authorized due to, but not limited to, insufficient or uncollected funds in the account or insufficient or inaccurate information I provided. I understand that the Power Up booking system allows for booking through the week regardless of the renewal date of my contract. I understand that if I am booked in classes past the date of renewal, and my credit or debit card fails to bill properly, I will be removed from any classes past the renewal date and notified via electronic mail. I understand that if I am removed from class due to the circumstances as described, it may not be possible to place me back into the class for which I was originally booked and that I will not be given any priority in waitlisted classes. I also understand that it is my responsibility to keep my card on file current and my billing address and zip code accurate. Power Up cannot be held responsible for errors in processing due to expired or inaccurate information.\r\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT IN CLASSES AT POWER UP\r\n\nPower Up conducts high intensity, choreographed, cardio classes on the SynergyAIR Power Tower. Please be aware that temperatures may reach 30° in certain classes. Music will be played which may contain explicit language. If you are sensitive to heat or explicit music, please check with our front desk staff to find the right instructor to meet your needs.\r\n\nWAIVER AND RELEASE\r\n\nBy signing up for and/or attending Power Up classes, activities and other programs, and using Power Up premises, facilities, and equipment (collectively, Classes and Facilities), you hereby agree that there are certain inherent risks and dangers in indoor fitness centres and exercise and in using indoor exercise equipment in association with the Classes and Facilities.
