      Classes are offered at Power Up 6 days a week. Classes can be booked
      online once you create an account. After you have paid classes on your
      account you can schedule a space on a tower.

      Classes may be canceled up to 24 hours prior to the scheduled class and

      24 hours of your class, your class credit will not be returned to your
      account. If you have an unlimited monthly and do not cancel more than 24
      hours in advance, you will be charged a late cancellation fee equivalent
      to the single class rate. Please cancel through the Power Up website. At
      this time, we do not accept cancellations via email, Facebook, Instagram,
